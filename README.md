## Setup
* Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following contents
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR UNIQUE OPEN AI API KEY>
``` 

## Tips
* Enter `exit` to end the program
* I recommend restarting every so often to lower AI token usage. This is because it resets the chat history.
* You can remove problems from the `problems.json` file if you don't want them to show up.
* Whenever you get a question correct, it is progressively less likely to appear in the future.
